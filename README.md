**Project 7 - Treehouse Front End Web Deveopment Techdegree**    
***WebApp Dashboard***

For this project, we were given a mockup of a web app dashboard, as well as some member images and some icon svgs.  From the mockup, we were to create the html for the just the main page of the dashboard,  using CSS grid to layout the header, nav, and main section of the page, and the page should be responsive.  All svgs were to be used inline.  The page was to include an alert banner at the top of the main section, an alert icon in the header that transitioned on hover, 3 charts from a chart library like chartJS and the other sections as shown. 

When clicking on the 'Send' button in the message area, a confirmation should be displayed that the message was sent using JS, but actual functionality was not required.  I chose to create a modal window for this confirmation message, which can be closed by clicking on the 'X', clicking anywhere on the page that is not the modal window, or pressing 'esc'.  Error messages should be shown if the user/message was missing.  


***Exceeds Expectations***
* The main chart includes navigation that changes the data displayed
* When clicking on the alert icon in the header, at least 2 alerts should be shown. I used the modal window to display this.
* The member/customer field displays a working autocomplete that allows a user to search for a customer.
* Settings information is saved to localStorage and the settings are remembered on page load.
